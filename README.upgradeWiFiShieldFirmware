I googled around for 'arduino wifi shield connection refused'

Search pages seemed to indicate  that the Arduino WiFi Shield firmware
needed to be upgraded.  I looked at the following links to do this.



Arduino WiFi Shield
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoWiFiShield

Connection with Arduino on SPI port
FTDI connection for serial debugging of WiFi shield
* Mini-USB for updating WiFi shield firmware
Encryption types: WEP and WPA2 Personal

The  Arduino WiFi Shield  allows an  Arduino board  to connect  to the
internet using the 802.11  wireless specification (WiFi).  It is based
on the  HDG204 Wireless LAN  802.11b/g System in-Package.   An AT32UC3
provides a  network (IP) stack capable  of both TCP and  UDP.  Use the
WiFI library to write sketches which connect to the internet using the
shield.

The  WiFi  Shield  can  connect  to wireless  networks  which  operate
according to the 802.11b and 802.11g specifications.

It is compatible with the Arduino Uno and Mega.

...specific pins which should not be used, see image:

...


The  previous version  of this  shield uses  a HDG104  instead  of the
actual HDG204.  BOTH MY wifi shields ARE HDG204.

The reset button on the shield resets both the HDG204 and the Arduino board.

WiFiAdditionalPorts_2.jpg:
* Shows  the DFU  Programming Jumper,  used only  for  updating shield
  firmware, leave unconnected for typical use.

* The Micro-USB port is used for firmware upgrades.  It is for updating
  the AT32UC3 using the Atmel DFU protocol.

* The programming jumper  adjacent to the power bus  and analog inputs
  should be left unconnected for typical  use. It is only used for DFU
  programming mode.


A  FTDI  connection enables  serial  communication  with  the 32U  for
debugging purposes. A list of available commands can be found here.


The shield contains a number of informational LEDs:

L9 (yellow) : this is tied to digital pin 9
LINK (green) : indicates a connection to a network
ERROR (red) : indicates when there is a communication error
DATA (blue) : indicates data being transmitted/received

Updating Firmware on the shield:


Upgrading the WiFi Shield Firmware
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/WiFiShieldFirmwareUpgrading

The WiFi shield provides wireless connectivity per the IEEE 802.11 b/g
standard through the  HDG204 (or HDG104) module. The  TCP/IP stack and
the  APIs  for  WiFi  library  are managed  by  the  AT32UC3A1512  (or
AT32UC3A1256) called AT32UC3 for short microcontroller on the shield.

Your Arduino connects to the shield using SPI through the WiFi library.


* Both the AT32UC3 and the HDG204/HDG104 modules have firmware
  upgradable through the mini USB connector.

This tutorial shows you how to upgrade :

* the HDG204/HDG104 WiFi module firmware, for when the manufacturer
  provides a new firmware binary for their device.

* the AT32UC3 when there is a new version of the firmware available from
  Arduino.

WHEN UPGRADING THE  FIRMWARE, THE WIFI SHIELD SHOULD  NOT BE CONNECTED
TO THE ARDUINO BOARD.


Upgrading the firmware on the devices is a two step process:

* The HDG204/HDG104 firmware is named "wifi_dnld.elf". 
* iFi shield firmware for the AT32UC3. The "wifiHD.elf"

Download a DFU Programmer:

sudo apt-get install dfu-programmer

Download updated firmware for the 32UC3A1256/AT32UC3A1256

The latest version is here:
https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/master/hardware/arduino/avr/firmwares

The  firmware  is  also  located  with the  Arduino  software  in  the
/hardware/avr/arduino/firmwares/wifishield folder.


Linux and Mac procedure:

wifishield-master.zip contains the following scripts, downloaded from
the above wifi shield page, ie:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoWiFiShield

wifishield-master/firmware/scripts

The WiFi shield  upgrading script also make use  of the dfu-programmer
that you need to install on your system previously (make sure that the
version is 0.5.4 or later), mine is version 0.6.1 on ubuntu14.04.

Connect  a jumper  on the  J3 connector,  that put  the shield  in the
programming mode.  Then connect the USB  cable to the  shield USB mini
socket.

On Linux  and Mac we  wrote a script  that automates the  process. The
script is a  command line utility, so  in order to use it  you need to
open a terminal on your system.


On  Linux you  need  to run  the script  as  root in  order to  access
correctly to the USB DFU peripherals.

wifishield-master/firmware/scripts/ArduinoWifiShield_upgrade.sh

./ArduinoWifiShield_upgrade.sh -h
chmod 744 ArduinoWifiShield_upgrade.sh


-a  parameter   you'll  pass  to   the  script  the   current  Arduino
 installation path, for example: /home/user/Coding

-f parameter you'll make the choice of which firmware install:

shield   to upgrade only the shield firmware
all      to upgrade both the firmwares

How to Update the Arduino WiFi Shield Firmware
Fri 21 March 2014


This gets you a copy of new wifishield firmware, unfortunatly I am
forced to download/clone from the root of the arduinoIDE:
git clone https://github.com/arduino/Arduino.git

gyan1: /lu1/smagri/sftw/arduino% git clone https://github.com/arduino/Arduino.git
Cloning into 'Arduino'...
remote: Counting objects: 76704, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (498/498), done.
Receiving objects:   8% (6335/76704), 35.18 MiB | 74.00 KiB/s     

...


You can double-check that you have the right version by going to lines
41-42 of wifishield/wifiHD/src/main.c. They should say this:

/* FIRMWARE version */
const char* fwVersion = "1.1.0";

...

Note,  wifishield-master.zip  linked from  the  main arduino  firmware
upgrade page points you to this  in one spot.  When checking main.c as
above in Katrina's page fwVersion was still 1.0.0.

http://blog.braddonnelly.com/arduino-wifi-shield-and-web-server-tutorial/
Also, these lines in your code will tell you what firmware version you
are running.
// display wifi shield firmware version,
// version < 1.1 requres a firmware update of wifi shield
Serial.print("Firmware  Version(version  <  1.1.0 requires  firmware upgrade):");
Serial.println(WiFi.firmwareVersion());

Where should I put it?   The official instructions are not clear about
where to  keep the new firmware.  Putting them in  an arbitrary folder
caused me  a lot  of problems  later on. I  RECOMMEND KEEPING  THE NEW
VERSION WHERE  THE OLD VERSION  USED TO BE.  Back up the  old firmware
with version control or by copying it to a different directory outside
of Arduino.app.

DFU Programmer  is the  software that gets  your new firmware  on your
Arduino (DFU  stands for 'Device  Firmware Update'). Simply, execute:
sudo apt-get install dfu-programmer.

You need  to set  the jumper  to put the  WiFi shield  in programmable
mode. The jumper  is a a tall, rectangular piece  on your WiFi shield,
located near  the power and ground pins.   To set it, pull  it off and
replace it  so that it  sits over both  pins. This puts the  shield in
programmable  mode, allowing you  to update  the firmware.   After the
update, you'll need to unset it before you use your Arduino again.

You  can transfer  the new  firmware to  the Arduino  with one  of the
install scripts, you MUST RUN IT AS ROOT:
wifishield/firmware/scripts/ArduinoWifiShield_upgrade.sh

Before you run it, you'll have to  fix a small error in the path where
it looks for the firmware. Change:

So in script we have the following two lines regarding paths:
WIFI_FW_PATH="/hardware/arduino/firmwares/wifi-shield"
AVR_TOOLS_PATH="/hardware/tools/avr/bin"


Firstly, change:
WIFI_FW_PATH="/hardware/arduino/firmwares/wifi-shield"

to:

WIFI_FW_PATH="/hardware/arduino/firmwares/wifishield"

So, FULL PATH for me is:
    /usr/share/arduino/hardwre/arduino/firmware/wifishield
with ROOT OF PATH for me is:
     /usr/share/arduino

FULL PATH for me is:
     /usr/share/arduino/hardware/tools/avr/bin
With ROOT OF PATH for me is:
     /usr/share/arduino
AVR_TOOLS_PATH=/hardware/tools/avr/bin


-a  parameter   you'll  pass  to   the  script  the   current  Arduino
 installation path, for me this will be: /usr/share/arduino

-f parameter you'll make the choice of which firmware install:

shield   to upgrade only the shield firmware
all      to upgrade both the firmwares

-f shield, only upgrade the shield firmware

MUST be run as ROOT:
sudo ArduinoWifiShield_upgrade.sh -a /usr/share/arduino -f shield

ACTUAL:
sudo sh ArduinoWifiShield_upgrade.sh -a /usr/share/arduino -f shield

Done. Remove the J3 jumper and press the RESET button on the shield.
Thank you!


Check that the install was successful, via:


#include <WiFi.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("the version is: ");
  Serial.println(WiFi.firmwareVersion());
}

void loop() {
}


*** It should say the version is:
    1.1.0


Final Note:
 When trying to update the firmware on a second wifi shield
I needed to unplug the usb(std->microusb) programming cable and
replugin.

Then just run:

cd /usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/firmwares/wifishield/script

sudo sh ./ArduinoWifiShield_upgrade.sh -a /usr/share/arduino -f shield
