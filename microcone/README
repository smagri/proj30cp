The last couple of days I have been working on getting data from the
microcone via the ALSA usb sound driver(default sound card on my
laptop).  Using various inputs(microcone, a standard laptop mic, and a
pro voice mic) I created raw pcm files(​*.raw) from some C code and
(*​.mp3s) from a standard opensource application called audacity.
